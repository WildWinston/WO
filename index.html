    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals (Stone, Teal) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a single-page dashboard with four main, navigable sections: 'Dashboard' (a landing/overview page), 'Log Workout' (the primary user task area), 'My Progress' (for data visualization), and 'Exercise Library' (a reference section). This task-oriented, non-linear structure was chosen over a simple replication of the source guide's layout because it directly maps to the core user goals: logging a workout, and checking progress. This approach enhances usability by providing clear, distinct areas for each key action, making navigation intuitive and efficient for a user actively engaged in a fitness routine. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The application translates the source guide's concepts into functional, interactive elements. Key choices include: 1) Goal: Log a workout -> Method: An interactive form instead of a static table, allowing dynamic addition of exercises and sets. This provides a superior, less error-prone user experience. 2) Goal: Track progression -> Method: An interactive line chart (Chart.js) dynamically updated by a dropdown selector for each exercise. This visualizes strength gains over time, which is the ultimate goal mentioned in the source material. A data table provides granular details. 3) Goal: Browse exercises -> Method: A filterable grid of cards, offering a more engaging and scannable interface than a simple database view. Justification: These choices prioritize interactivity and clear data visualization to make the application an effective tool, not just a static report. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
